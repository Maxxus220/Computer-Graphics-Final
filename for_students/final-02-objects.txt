(Required) Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. Skyscraper - Large buildings each have bumpmaps both black and white and colored variations
2. Bush - Bush with a bumpmap created by desaturating the image and smoothing the colors a bit

(Required) Five other kinds of objects that you created (possibly in previous assignments):
All or almost all objects have had an additional black and white variation created for them
3. Road - Simple short box geometry
4. Building with red roof - Bulding from wkbk 8 adapted by adding bumpmaps to the roof and brick textures using similar desaturation technique
5. Building with gravel roof - Building from wkbk 8 adapted by adding bumpmaps same technique
6. Trucks - Truck from wkbk 8
7. Passengers - Simple box geometries

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
- Frontloader - Construction object from wkbk 8
- ???
- ???

At least one of each type of object:
Building/structure: Skyscraper
Vehicle: Car
Natural Element: Bush

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: Car - Car obj found online attribution in attributions txt file

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: Car/groundplane - Both car and groundplane have similar shaders. Car checks world position for color. Groundplane checks uv for color.

Other Objects that you would like to note:
